# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer: A parameter is a reusable dynamic variable, with limitations. An Argument pass through an objects 

  Researched answer:  Parameters are the names listed in the function definition. Arguments are built-into objects, they are the real values passed to (and received by) the functio



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: .map takes in values, index and arrays.  

  Researched answer: .map ceates an array by calling a specific function on each element present in the parent array. It is a non-mutating method. Generally .map() method is used to iterate over an array and calling function on every element of array. for this method, you need an element; index, and array are optional. 



3. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Object destructuring breaks down values and create new varialbels, assigns them in a single assignment. 

  Researched answer:  A way of creating new variables by breaking down a values into indivdual variables, and assigns them as single assignments; requires variable names [] and an equal number of values. 



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: A function give instruction on how to get a task done, the instrutions can be reused in the code. A method takes actions on a object.

5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer:  Classes are blueprint for objects, similar to functions, they are reusable and can be changed accordingly; are dynamic. Objects takes in instances; are hard coded values

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: I do not know what the definition of hoisting. nor do I know what it does. 

  Researched answer:  Hoisting is the default behavior of moving all the declarations at the top of the scope before code execution. Basically, it gives us an advantage that no matter where functions and variables are declared, they are moved to the top of their scope regardless of whether their scope is global or local. It allows us to call functions before even writing them in our code. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance: Information that is pass down between a "parent-child" relationship within a code via inheritance to keep the code from being repetivie. 

2. React: A declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces; maintained by Facebook.

3. React state: State is a plain JavaScript object used by React to represent an information about the component's current situation. It's managed in the component (just like any variable declared in a function).
s:
4. React lifecycle method: Special build-in methods in React. It is used to operate on compoinents throughout their duration in the Document Object Model (DOM) 

5. DOM:  DOM he Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.
